This file contains 2-1/2D Electromagnetic Python PIC codes.  They are
based on the 2-1/2D Electromagnetic PIC codes contained in the directory
bpic2.  The primary purpose is to illustrate how to replace a Fortran or
C main code with a Python script, in order allow the program to be run
interactively.

Python version 2.7 is recommended, and is available from the web site:
www.python.org.  Numpy (http://www.numpy.org) and SciPy
(http://www.scipy.org) also need to be installed.

The file fbpic2.py is a line by line translation of bpic2.f90 in the
directory bpic2, and cbpic2.py is a translation of bpic2.c.  The
procedure libraries bpush2.f and bpush2.c are identical to those in
bpic2.  Interface functions bpush2_hpy.f90 and cbpush2_hpy.f90 are
provided to allow the f2py program to automatically wrap the procedures
to make them accessible to Python.  The file bpush2_hpy.f90 has been
modified from bpush2_h.f90 in bpic2 in two ways.  The first modification
was the removal of the module/end module statements, which fp2y cannot
currently handle properly.  The second was the replacement of
explicit-shape array declarations with assumed-size array declarations
so that f2py would not remove the arguments in the array declarations
from the argument list.  The file cbpush2_hpy.f90 is the same as
bpush2_hpy.f90, except that the function names have been changed to the
C versions.  This works because the file bpush2.c already contained
wrappers for Fortran.

The major program files contained here include:
fbpic2.py       Python main script for Fortran procedure library
cbpic2.py       Python main script for C procedure library
bpush2.f        Fortran77 procedure library
bpush2_hpy.f90  Fortran procedure interface (header) library
bpush2.c        C procedure library
bpush2.h        C procedure header library
cbpush2_hpy.f90 C procedure interface (header) library
dtimer.c       C timer function, used by both C and Fortran
dtimer_hpy.f90 C timer interface (header) library

Files with the suffix .f90 adhere to the Fortran 90 standard, files with
the suffix .f adhere to the Fortran77 standard, files with the suffix .c
and .h adhere to the C99 standard.

The makefile is setup to use gcc and gfortran with Linux.  Versions for
other compitlers are also in the Makefile but are commented out.

Two dynamic libraries can be created, fbpush2.so for Fortran and
cbpush2.so for C.  To create them, execute:

Make program_name

where program_name is either: fbpic2.py or cbpic2.py, or execute:

make

to create both libraries.

To execute, type the name of the executable:

python program_name

where program_name is either fbpic2.py or cbpic2.py.

The file output contains the results produced for the default parameters.
