# PIC Skeleton Codes:  QuickStart

These example codes show how to perform a simple parallel addition of two arrays using different parallel programming paradigms.  They are primarily intended to illustrate how to startup, run and shutdown a simple parallel code and how to compile and link it.  Examples are in both C and Fortran.

1. MPI:  smdemo_mpi
2. OpenMP:  smdemo_omp
3. Pthreads:  smdemo_pth
4. Cuda C:  smdemo_cu
5. Cuda Fortran:  smdemo_cuf
6. OpenCL:  smdemo_ocl
7. Intel SSE:  smdemo_sse
