This directory contains procedures that are useful for performing wave
diagnostics, such as measuring the wavenumber and frequency of plasma
waves, for the 3D Darwin MPI Particle-in-Cell (PIC) codes in the pdpic3
directory.  The procedures, written in Fortran, are in the file
pdfield3.f.  The file pdfield3_f.c contains wrapper functions to allow
the Fortran procedures to be called from C.

The electric and magnetic fields used to advance particles are smoothed
by suppressing large wavenumbers in order to avoid numerical errors due
to aliasing.  The field diagnostics, however, are normally unsmoothed.
The main diagnostics are the electrostatic potential and the vector
potential in fourier space, in the Coulomb gauge.  These are calculated
by the procedures PPOTP32 and PPAPOTP32, respectively.  Other
diagnostics, such as the unsmoothed longitudinal electric field and
magnetic field can be calculated from the potentials with the procedures
PPGRADF32 and PPCURLF32, respectively.  The procedure PPETFIELD332 can
be called to obtain the unsmoothed transverse electric field.  The
fourier modes are normally stored to disk for later post-processing,
such as by performing a fourier transform in time to obtain the
frequencies for different wavenumbers.  It is usually not necessary to
store all the modes to disk, since the high wavenumber modes are usually
unimportant.  Furthermore, the fourier modes are stored in a packed
format which is difficult to work with.  Thus procedures PPRDMODES32 and
PPRDVMODES32 are also provided to extract a subset of the fourier modes
for the potential and vector fields respectively, and copy them in an
unpacked format for easier post-processing. (The procedures PPWRMODES32
and PPWRVMODES32 are provided to repack the scalar or vector fourier
modes, if needed.)

To use these procedures, one first needs to add some declarations in the
main programs pdpic3.90 and pdpic3.c in the parent directory pdpic3,
similar to the following.

For Fortran:
   integer :: modesx, modesy, modesz, modesxpd, modesypd, modeszd
   complex, dimension(:,:,:), pointer :: potc, pott
   complex, dimension(:,:,:,:), pointer :: vpotc, vpott

For C:
   int modesx, modesy, modesz, modesxpd, modesypd, modeszd;
   float complex *potc = NULL, *pott = NULL;
   float complex *vpotc = NULL, *vpott = NULL;
   
Then before the main iteration loop, one needs to allocate the arrays.

For Fortran:
   modesx = nx/4; modesy = ny/4; modesz = nz/4
   modesxpd = min(modesx,kxyp); modesypd = kyzp
   modeszd = min(2*modesz-1,nz)
   if (modesx==(nx/2+1)) modesxpd = modesxpd + 1
   allocate(potc(nze,kxyp,kyzp),vpotc(ndim,nze,kxyp,kyzp))
   allocate(pott(modeszd,modesxpd,modesypd))
   allocate(vpott(ndim,modeszd,modesxpd,modesypd))

For C:
   modesx = nx/4; modesy = ny/4; modesz = nz/4;
   modesxpd = modesx < kxyp ? modesx : kxyp; modesypd = kyzp;
   modeszd = 2*modesz - 1;
   modeszd = modeszd < nz ? modeszd : nz;
   if (modesx==(nx/2+1))
      modesxpd += 1;
   potc = (float complex *) malloc(nze*kxyp*kyzp*sizeof(float complex));
   vpotc = (float complex *) malloc(ndim*nze*kxyp*kyzp
                                    *sizeof(float complex));
   pott = (float complex *) malloc(modeszd*modesxpd*modesypd
                                   *sizeof(float complex));
   vpott = (float complex *) malloc(ndim*modeszd*modesxpd*modesypd
                                    *sizeof(float complex));

Finally, in the main iteration loops just before the push procedures,
one can add some diagnostics, such as:

For Fortran:
! perform potential diagnostic and unpack into array pott
! updates potc, pott, wt
   call PPOTP32(qt,potc,ffc,wt,nx,ny,nz,kstrt,nvpy,nvpz,nze,kxyp,kyzp,
                nzh)
   call PPRDMODES32(potc,pott,nx,ny,nz,modesx,modesy,modesz,kstrt,nvpy,
                    nvpz,nze,kxyp,kyzp,modesxpd,modesypd,modeszd)

! perform vector potential diagnostic and unpack into array vpott
! updates vpotc, vpott, wt
   call PPAPOTP32(cut,vpotc,ffc,ci,wt,nx,ny,nz,kstrt,nvpy,nvpz,nze,kxyp,
                  kyzp,nzh)
   call PPRDVMODES32(vpotc,vpott,nx,ny,nz,modesx,modesy,modesz,ndim,
                     kstrt,nvpy,nvpz,nze,kxyp,kyzp,modesxpd,modesypd,
                     modeszd)

For C:
/* perform potential diagnostic and unpack into array pott */
/* updates potc, pott, wt                                  */
   cppotp32(qt,potc,ffc,&wt,nx,ny,nz,kstrt,nvpy,nvpz,nze,kxyp,kyzp,nzh);
   cpprdmodes32(potc,pott,nx,ny,nz,modesx,modesy,modesz,kstrt,nvpy,nvpz,
                nze,kxyp,kyzp,modesxpd,modesypd,modeszd);
/* perform vector potential diagnostic and unpack into array vpott */
/* updates vpotc, vpott, wt                                        */
   cppapotp32(cut,vpotc,ffc,ci,&wt,nx,ny,nz,kstrt,nvpy,nvpz,nze,kxyp,
              kyzp,nzh);
   cpprdvmodes32(vpotc,vpott,nx,ny,nz,modesx,modesy,modesz,ndim,kstrt,
                 nvpy,nvpz,nze,kxyp,kyzp,modesxpd,modesypd,modeszd);

One would have to modify the Makefile as well to include the files
pdfield3.f and pdfield3_f.c, as needed.
