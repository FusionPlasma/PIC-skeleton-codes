# PIC Skeleton Codes:  OpenMP

These codes illustrate how to use shared memory parallelism with OpenMP. The algorithm used here is the same as that used on the GPU: it divides particles into small tiles and reorders them every time step to avoid data collisions when performing the deposit. Each tile is controlled by a single thread. The algorithm is described in detail in Ref. [4]. For the 2D electrostatic code, a typical execution time for the particle part of this code is about 3 ns/particle/time-step with 12 processing cores. For the 2-1/2D electromagnetic code, a typical execution time for the particle part of this code is about 10 ns/particle/time-step with 12 processing cores. For the 2-1/2D Darwin code, a typical execution time for the particle part of this code is about 22 ns/particle/time-step with 12 processing cores. (All timings are on a 2.67GHz Intel Nehalem processor.)
