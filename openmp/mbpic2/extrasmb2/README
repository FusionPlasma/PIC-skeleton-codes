This directory contains procedures that are useful for performing wave
diagnostics, such as measuring the wavenumber and frequency of plasma
waves, for the 2-1/2D Electromagnetic OpenMP Particle-in-Cell (PIC)
codes in the mbpic2 directory.  The procedures, written in Fortran, are
in the file mbfield2.f.  The file mbfield2_f.c contains wrapper
functions to allow the Fortran procedures to be called from C.

The electric and magnetic fields used to advance particles are smoothed
by suppressing large wavenumbers in order to avoid numerical errors due
to aliasing.  The field diagnostics, however, are normally unsmoothed.
The main diagnostics are the electrostatic potential and the vector
potential in fourier space, in the Coulomb gauge.  These are calculated
by the procedures MPOTP2 and MAVPOT23, respectively.  Other diagnostics,
such as the unsmoothed longitudinal electric field and magnetic field
can be calculated from the potentials with the procedures MGRADF2 and
MCURLF2, respectively.  The procedure MAVRPOT23 can be called to
calculate the radiative part of the vector potential.  The fourier modes
are normally stored to disk for later post-processing, such as by
performing a fourier transform in time to obtain the frequencies for
different wavenumbers.  It is usually not necessary to store all the
modes to disk, since the high wavenumber modes are usually unimportant.
Furthermore, the fourier modes are stored in a packed format which is
difficult to work with.  Thus procedures RDMODES2 and RDVMODES2 are also
provided to extract a subset of the fourier modes for the potential and
vector fields respectively, and copy them in an unpacked format for
easier post-processing. (The procedures WRMODES2 and WRVMODES2 are
provided to repack the scalar or vector fourier modes, if needed.)

To use these procedures, one first needs to add some declarations in the
main programs mbpic2.90 and mbpic2.c in the parent directory mbpic2,
similar to the following.

For Fortran:
   integer :: modesx, modesy, modesxd, modesyd
   complex, dimension(:,:), pointer :: potc, pott
   complex, dimension(:,:,:), pointer :: vpotc, vpott

For C:
   int modesx, modesy, modesxd, modesyd;
   float complex *potc = NULL, *pott = NULL;
   float complex *vpotc = NULL, *vpott = NULL;
   
Then before the main iteration loop, one needs to allocate the arrays.

For Fortran:
   modesx = nx/4; modesy = ny/4
   modesxd = modesx; modesyd = min(2*modesy-1,ny)
   allocate(potc(nxeh,nye),vpotc(ndim,nxeh,nye))
   allocate(pott(modesxd,modesyd))
   allocate(vpott(ndim,modesxd,modesyd))

For C:
   modesx = nx/4; modesy = ny/4;
   modesxd = modesx; modesyd = 2*modesy - 1;
   modesyd = modesyd < ny ? modesyd : ny;
   potc = (float complex *) malloc(nxeh*nye*sizeof(float complex));
   vpotc = (float complex *) malloc(ndim*nxeh*nye*sizeof(float complex));
   pott = (float complex *) malloc(modesxd*modesyd*sizeof(float complex));
   vpott = (float complex *) malloc(ndim*modesxd*modesyd*sizeof(float complex));

Finally, in the main iteration loops just before the push procedures,
one can add some diagnostics, such as:

For Fortran:
! perform potential diagnostic and unpack into array pott
! updates potc, pott, wt
   call MPOTP2(qe,potc,ffc,wt,nx,ny,nxeh,nye,nxh,nyh)
   call RDMODES2(potc,pott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,nxeh,nye,modesxd,modesyd)
! perform vector potential diagnostic and unpack into array vpott
! updates vpotc, vpott
   call MAVPOT23(bxyz,vpotc,nx,ny,nxeh,nye)
   call RDVMODES2(vpotc,vpott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,ndim,nxeh,nye,modesxd,modesyd)

For C:
/* perform potential diagnostic and unpack into array pott */
/* updates potc, pott, wt                                  */
   cmpotp2((float complex *)qe,potc,ffc,&wt,nx,ny,nxeh,nye,nxh,nyh);
   crdmodes2(potc,pott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,nxeh,nye,modesxd,modesyd);
/* perform vector potential diagnostic and unpack into array vpott */
/* updates vpotc, vpott                                            */
   cmavpot23(bxyz,vpotc,nx,ny,nxeh,nye);
   crdvmodes2(vpotc,vpott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,ndim,nxeh,nye,modesxd,modesyd);

One would have to modify the Makefile as well to include the files
mbfield2.f and mbfield2_f.c, as needed.
