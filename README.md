# PIC-skeleton-codes
A fully-functional but simple Particle-In-Cell Plasma Simulation Code with several parallel implementations ( OPEN MP, SSE, AVX, CUDA). This code is meant to highlight the parallelization methods of the core PIC algorithm while implementing only a minimal feature set in favor of clarity, ease of use, and extensibility.
