## Quick Start

Welcome! There is a large collection of PIC codes here with a range of complexity. They are all deigned to be easy to read, understand, and adapt. Eash directory is a complete, standalone PIC implemenation.

The place to start is ""pic2"". This is the basic, ""classic"" serial Particle-In-Cell code. For those new to PIC it is the perfect place to start.. no bells.. no whistles.. but a simple way to see how PICS codes work. For people already experienced with PIC, the ""pic2"" implmentation can be used in benchmarking or as unit-testing scaffolding.

These codes have no external dependecies - You should be able to set basic coniguration and then type 'make'.. For full instructions see the readme files in each directory.
